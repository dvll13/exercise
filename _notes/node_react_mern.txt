NODE - a platform that allows running javascript on a computer
REPL - read evaluate print loop (node console)


ENTER NODE CONSOLE
------------------
type `node` in the normal console
you have top level `global` and `process` objects
entire app is running in the `process` module, so what's added to the process.exports object (private - can be checked by console.log(process) from the app) will be visible throughout the whole app


npm init - initialize a project and auto create a package.json
`nodemon` package - reloading the server on file changes
express - server


NODE EVENT LOOP (asynchronous programming) single threaded non blocking model, callbacks, FIFO; the called callbacks get in the stack and executed from there


fs.watch(fileName, onFileChange)
fs.readFile(fileName, (error, data) => {}) - asynchronous
const data = fs.readFileSync(fileName) - synchronous, no callback
