ENTER NODE CONSOLE
------------------
type `node` in the normal console
you have top level `global` and `process` objects
entire app is running in the `process` module, so what's added to the process.exports object (private) will be visible throughout the whole app

ARROW FUNCTIONS don't have their own context (`this` points to the upper context)

npm init - initialize a project and auto create a package.json
`nodemon` package - reloading the server on file changes

NODE EVENT LOOP - single threaded non blocking model, callbacks, FIFO
