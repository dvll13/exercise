# indexedDB
_IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. This API uses indexes to enable high-performance searches of this data. While Web Storage is useful for storing smaller amounts of data, it is less useful for storing larger amounts of structured data. IndexedDB provides a solution._

`localForage` - an `npm` helper lib that makes the usage of async storage like IndexedDB or WebSQL easier with a localStorage-way of interaction. It uses localStorage in browsers with no IndexedDB or WebSQL
